ISPConfig_Clean
===============

A cleaner theme for ISPConfig 3. The default theme leaves a lot to be desired.

Be sure to pick the correct branch. There were some changes that were made to the theming system that break the 3.4 version inside of 3.5

Installation
------------

1. Copy this folder to your /usr/local/ispconfig/web/interface/themes/ISPConfig_Clean
2. Edit /usr/local/ispconfig/web/interface/lib/config.inc.php default theme to ISPConfig_Clean
3. Edit the header logo location. Change default to ISPConfig_Clean is all that needs to be done.
4. Enjoy the new theme. I will be making changes as I have time.
